# Thermal_comfort_prediction
## Description
This project involves the analysis and prediction of thermal comfort using the ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II, primarily constructed by the University of Berkeley. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis and potentially create a predictor for thermal comfort perception. The data comprises approximately 100,000 individuals described by 70 attributes from various open-access research datasets. Although the data is tabular, it presents complexity due to the significant number of missing values and multiple categorical attributes.

## Project Structure
- **Data**: Contains the raw data files used for analysis.
- **src**: Scripts and notebooks for data analysis and cleaning.
- **Report**: Detailed project report in PDF format and PowerPoint slides summarizing the project findings.
